This is a tiny fun project to see how Pygame works in Python. I had a silly idea of Yordles going through jungle within League of Legends.

If whoever may read this is familiar with League of Legends, I had a League game where a bunch of yordle champions were just, in our jungle. I had no other idea to think of so here we are.
